title: Making OpenAPI and AsyncAPI Dynamic with Geneva
---

import Link from "next/link";

Hi! My name is Stephen Mizell. I'm a Director of Product Management at SmartBear for SwaggerHub, an API design and collaboration tool. However, I'm not talking about SwaggerHub today. Instead I'm talking about a personal project called Geneva. This means what I share today will be my own words.

To start, thanks for tuning in today to this [ASC 2020](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/openapi-asc/) sessions. I know these are strange and difficult times for everyone. I appreciate you for changing up the way you attend a conference and joining this session.

## Contact info

You can find me on Twitter at [@Stephen_Mizell](https://twitter.com/Stephen_Mizell). If you'd like to discuss anything around this topic or talk, feel free to email me at smizell@hey.com.

## Our topic of discussion for today

Today I'm going to share a tool called [Geneva](https://github.com/smizell/geneva/) that allows you to make OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, or any YAML document dynamic. It's as much an idea as it is a tool. Even if Geneva isn't a good fit for you, I hope this talk will spark new and better ideas around this topic.

## Where are the slides?

Given our situation, I decided to try out something different. Instead of creating slides and sharing a slide show, I decided to write out my talk and build it into a website. This lets me provide something for people who aren't able to see or hear the presentation, it lets attendees try out the demos I'll be showing, and it works as a backup in case my internet goes down.

Feel free to click around and explore as I talk—I won't mind.

## Try out some of the code

You'll see Geneva code examples throughout this talk. You can tinker with them by clicking the "edit" button. Once you've made changes and clicked "Done," the code will be rerun.

Don't worry—your changes won't show up on my screen. I also am not capturing anything you type.

## Our agenda

1. **Introduction** - I’ll introduce you to Geneva
1. **Use cases** - We’ll look at ways you might use it
1. **Closing thoughts** - Bringing it all together
1. **Questions and answers** - You have questions, and I might have an answer

Alright, here we go!
