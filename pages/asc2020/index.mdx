# Making OpenAPI and AsyncAPI Dynamic with Geneva

Hi! My name is Stephen Mizell. I'm a Director of Product Management at SmartBear for SwaggerHub, an API design and collaboration tool. However, I'm not talking about SwaggerHub today. Instead I'm talking about a personal project called Geneva. This means what I share today will be my own words.

To start, thanks for tuning in today. I know these are strange and difficult times for everyone. I appreciate you for changing up the way you attend a conference and joining this session.

## Our topic of discussion for today

Today I'm going to share a tool called Geneva that allows you to make OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, or any YAML document dynamic. It's as much an idea as it is a tool. Even if Geneva isn't a good fit for you, I hope this talk will spark new and better ideas around this topic.

## Where are the slides?

Given our situation, I decided to try out something different. Instead of creating slides and sharing a slide show, I decided to write out my talk and build it into a website. This lets me provide something for people who aren't able to see or hear the presentation. It lets attendees try out the demoes I'll be showing. And it works as a backup in case my internet goes down.

Feel free to click around and explore as I talk if you prefer that moreâ€”I won't mind.
