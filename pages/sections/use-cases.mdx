# Use cases for making things more dynamic

We have a lot of dynamic things we want to do in our API definitions. I want to look at use cases and examples that show how one might use Geneva to solve them.

## We want reusability

As noted, we've added keywords like `$ref` to specifications to help people make things reusable. We want to define once and reuse all over. Geneva does this by way of `ref:`.

```yaml:geneva-context
show:
  scope: true
  definition: true
  result: true
scope:
  info:
    contact:
      name: API Support
      url: http://www.example.com/support
      email: support@example.com
definition:
  openapi: 3.0.0
  info: ref:info
```

This differs from `$ref` that we find in OpenAPI and JSON Schema. The `ref` here is referencing a variable in the current scope. Geneva lets you define variables and reuse them through the entire definition. This means Geneva's `ref` and `$ref` can be used together.

```yaml:geneva-context
show:
  scope: true
  definition: true
  result: true
scope:
  schemas:
    customer:
      $ref: https://example.com/customer.yml
definition:
  openapi: 3.0.0
  components:
    schemas:
      Customer: ref:schemas.customer
```

This could be a way to pass in different schemas for different builds.

## We want to compose files together

Left untended, YAML documents grow in complexity and size. It's not easy to read or edit a 10,000 line YAML document. The next step is to break files like this into multiple files.

Here is create a mock file system that I reference in the definition. Geneva allows for passing in the normal file system modules, though this might not be safe.

```yaml:geneva-context
show:
  files: true
  definition: true
  result: true
files:
  infoFile: |
    contact:
      name: API Support
      url: http://www.example.com/support
      email: support@example.com
definition:
  openapi: 3.0.0
  info:
    fn:include: infoFile
```

Imagine including Markdown files that technical writers put together. Or adding in security definitions managed by the security team. Or pulling in operations defined in a separate file. 

## We want localization

Similarly, people may want to add localization to their OpenAPI or AsyncAPI definition. Instead of adding localization to the specification, people could pass in different languages to build separate final OpenAPI definitions.

```yaml:geneva-context
show:
  scope: true
  definition: true
  result: true
scope: |
  lang: en
  locale:
    userSignedupDescription:
      en: An event describing that a user just signed up.
  getLocale:
    fn:lambda:
      - term
      - fn:path:
          - [ref:term, ref:lang]
          - ref:locale
definition:
  asyncapi: "2.0.0"
  info:
    title: Example
    version: 0.1.0
  channels:
    user/signedup:
      subscribe:
        message:
          description:
            fn:getLocale: userSignedupDescription
```

If you look, you'll see that I use `fn:lambda`, which is a function definition. I'm making my own function to use throughout my definition. I'll let you decide if this is a great or horrible idea.

## We want base definitions

Sometimes we want to add certain status codes to every response in an OpenAPI definition. This happens for error codes that all return the same error format.

```yaml:geneva-context
show:
  scope: true
  definition: true
  result: true
scope:
  postResponses:
    fn:lambda:
      - responses
      - fn:mergeDeepLeft:
          - responses:
              "405":
                description: Method Not Allowed
                content:
                  "application/json": {}
          - ref:responses
definition:
  openapi: 3.0.0
  paths:
    /customers:
      post:
        fn:postResponses:
          responses:
            "200":
              description: Customer added
              content:
                "application/json": {}
```
