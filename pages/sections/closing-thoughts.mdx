# Closing thoughts

## What are downsides?

1. **This may not be better than using code**. AWS has gone the code route with the [Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/).
1. **It's not easy to debug**. Geneva isn't mature, so it lacks debugging tools and clear feedback that mature languages give you.
1. **There may be better tools out there**. There is a programmable configuration language called [Dhall](https://dhall-lang.org/).
1. **You're no longer writing in the specification**. If you're writing in a new format, you lose any benefits your editor might provide for writing directly in the specification.

## What could be next?

There are lots of things I'd do differently with Geneva. And there are lots of directions I'd love to go in the future.

1. **Define a standard**. Geneva has a few rules that can be standardized.
1. **Make it cross-platform**. Right now
