## There's more to Geneva

1. Geneva has a CLI for executing files.
1. Geneva has a special Definition Builder that works like Azure's ARM templates.
1. Geneva has a REPL.
1. You can pass regular code into Geneva, so most JavaScript code will work.
1. As we see here, Geneva can run in the browser.

## What are downsides?

1. **This may not be better than using code**. AWS has gone the code route with the [Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/).
1. **It's not easy to debug**. Geneva isn't mature, so it lacks debugging tools and clear feedback that mature languages give you.
1. **There may be better tools out there**. There is a programmable configuration language called [Dhall](https://dhall-lang.org/).
1. **You're no longer writing in the specification**. If you're writing in a new format, you lose any benefits your editor might provide for writing directly in the specification.

## What could be next?

1. **Define a standard**. Geneva has a few rules that can be standardized.
1. **Make it cross-platform**. Geneva is in JavaScript and relies on JavaScript libraries.
1. **Add support for real code**. If it's true that people are moving to use real programming languages, it's an opportunity to create standards and tools that follow the trends.

## Thank you

I hope Geneva has a few features you've been wanting. I hope it sparks new and better ideas about how to think about making specifications more dynamic.

If you're interested, check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/smizell/geneva). Drop an issue there if you have questions or ideas.

Thanks for your time!
